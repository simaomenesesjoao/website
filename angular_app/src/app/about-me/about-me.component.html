<h1> About me </h1>
<div class="container">
    <div class="column-text-large">

        <p> I'm <strong>Simão Meneses João</strong> — a Portuguese Physicist and Software Engineer currently living in London. I love exploring how the world works, especially through the lens of Physics and Mathematics, and I built this website to share my interactive simulations and quirky discoveries with fellow curious minds. </p>

        <p> I have a <strong>PhD in Quantum Mechanics and Computational Physics</strong>, having spent many years studying how very tiny particles move when you give them funny materials to move around in. I'm also unnofficially certified in <strong>advanced seagull screeching</strong>, a skill that hilariously brought me much more media recognition than my research ever did.</p>

        <p> I enjoy playing Tom Lehrer songs on the piano and studying Russian. I even got a Russian girlfriend to make it cheaper. I would  never let you forget that I'm from Portugal, that Pastel de Nata is the best food in existence and that chickens make the best pets.</p>

    <h1> About me (unabridged)</h1>
    Below is a more detailed account of events from my life that got me to where I am today. But because no-one likes to read a boring life story, I asked ChatGPT to crank up the drama. The result is a silly and <i><b>slightly</b></i> exaggerated story, that I still find pretty funny. Enjoy!

    <h3> Made in Madeira </h3>
    <p>I emerged into this world in 1994, cradled by the emerald embrace of <b>Madeira</b>—an island revered for its natural beauty. My earliest memories are stitched with sound. The garden buzzed with birdsong, a living orchestra flitting through banana leaves. Inside, my father's Beatles vinyls spun on repeat, melodies swirling in the air like incense. And my sister? A siren of the stage, belting out arias and showtunes from <i>Handel</i> to <i>Grease</i>, filling every corner of our home with musical joy. My mother was not devoted to music, but to the <b>natural world</b>—each walk in nature a lecture, each flower a question. From her, I inherited not rhythm or harmony, but an insatiable hunger to <i>understand</i>. The “why” behind the “what,” the <b>invisible mechanics behind beauty</b>.</p>

    <p>At the Madeira Conservatory, I was baptized in a childhood of music. I experimented with several instruments, but what truly captured my soul was not sound—but structure. Music Theory. The architecture beneath the art. Logic disguised as song. Mathematics wrapped in emotion. It felt like doing algebra with my ears. And I loved it.</p>

    <p>But as I neared the finale of my schooling, another chord began to resonate deep within me. I was obsessed with <i>building</i>, with taking things apart and resurrecting them better than before. Maybe it was all the SimCity I played as a kid, but I dreamed of becoming an architect, crafting structures from imagination. That is… until the universe modulated to a new key.</p>

        <h3>Academic Aspirations</h3>
        <p>Then came <b>2011</b>—the year the winds changed.My Physics teacher, knowing I had a crush on Science, looked me in the eye and dropped a gauntlet at my feet:  
        <i>"Why don't you compete in the Portuguese Physics Olympiads?"</i></p>

        <p>Was she <i>mad</i>? Me? Compete? I was just some curious kid who liked numbers and occasionally daydreamed about atoms. What possible chance did I have? I laughed. She didn't. In that moment, something stirred. A mixture of panic, doubt… and <i>possibility</i>. Like a storm cloud forming just offshore, charged with something electric. This wasn't just a school contest—it was a portal. And I, hesitant and wide-eyed, stepped through it.</p>

        <p>Armed with nothing but a battered calculator and a dangerous dose of naïve optimism, I stepped into the arena of the Portuguese Physics Olympiads—and won! That single moment cracked the world open. I was invited to Coimbra, to join <b>Projecto Quark!</b>, an elite academy for young scientific minds, where the laws of the cosmos became my playground.</p>

        <p>Physics, Mathematics, Programming—once distinct disciplines—now danced together like particles in a quantum ballet. I returned to Madeira different. Awakened. I stood at a fork in the road: stay in the safety of island life, following my architectural dreams, or leap into the unknown, chasing this newfound obsession with the secrets of the universe?</p>

        <p>With my family's blessing (and perhaps a bit of relief at finally getting some peace and quiet), I said goodbye to the mountains of Madeira and stepped into the tempest of Porto—the city of Francesinhas, and seagulls with a vendetta. Here, I honed my craft. A Master's in Theoretical Physics. A PhD in Computational Physics. Ten years of sleepless nights, chalkboards full of madness, and a supervisor who knew everything about everything (or so he thought)—and wasn't shy about it. I also learned to live with the voracious seagulls, befriend them, become one with them.</p>

        <p>And yet, as my academic odyssey neared its end, the light began to dim. I still adored teaching, inventing, discovering… but the reality of academia was a cage wrapped in prestige. I was ready to walk away.</p>

        <h3> London Leap</h3>

        <p>Then—<b>London called</b>. A letter. An offer. A research position at none other than <b>Imperial College</b>—a temple of science towering in the heart of one of the world's wildest cities. </p>

        <p>It was a chance. A resurrection. A promise that maybe, just <i>maybe</i>, academia could be different this time. Gentler. Wilder. More <i>me</i>.</p>

        <p>So I packed my books, my doubts, my dreams—and I went. Across the sea, into the storm, chasing that flicker of hope wrapped in prestige and possibility.</p>

        <p>London, the chaotic symphony of cultures and contradictions, greeted me like an old friend I hadn't met yet. I found myself surrounded by creativity, boldness, <i>silliness</i>. Finally, I could be all parts of myself—physicist, fool, artist.</p>

        <p>There, I met <b>Ava</b>—brilliant, inquisitive, and unapologetically fond of cats. Our conversations danced between Computer Science, abstract algebra, and debating the true complexity of Radix sort.</p>

        <p>And then the seagulls made a return.</p>

        <h3>Silly Seagulls</h3>

        <p>Inspired by London's eccentric charm and haunted by my past battles with Porto's airborne terrors, I flew to Belgium in 2024 to compete in the <b>European Seagull Screeching Competition</b>. Years of ear-training, music theory, and surviving Porto rooftops converged in one explosive screech. I won. Gold. Glory. Chaos.</p>

        <p>For a brief moment, I was <i>famous</i> Everyone and their dog suddenly knew about me. Not for my research. But for mimicking the cry of a seagull so convincingly that judges wept.</p>

        <p>But when the feathers settled and the applause faded, a different sound crept in: <b>doubt</b>.</p>

        <p>What would my peers think? Would I forever be branded <i>"that seagull guy"</i>—a walking punchline flapping his wings through faculty meetings?  Did I even screech that well?</p>

        <p>Insecurity perched on my shoulder, pecking at the edges of my confidence. But beneath the absurdity, something quietly shifted. That ridiculous, glorious competition had cracked open a truth I hadn't dared face: I didn't need to be a citation machine. I didn't need a title to justify my existence. I didn't need permission to be <i>me</i>.</p>

        <p>My peers? They laughed—but with me, not at me. They celebrated. Cheered. Not because I was academically validated, but because I had done something <i>wildly</i> human.</p>

        <p>And so I learned: <b>prestige is not identity</b>. It's okay to be silly. It's okay to be strange. It's okay to step off the beaten track and waddle a bit.</p>

        <p>Most people won't care. But the ones who do? <i>They matter</i>. And they'll see you—not just your résumé.</p>

        <h3>Return to the Roots</h3>
        <p>So I walked away. From institutional research. From the ivory towers. From the conferences with bad coffee and worse PowerPoints. Not back to Madeira, but back to the beginning. To <i>play</i>. To wonder. To building things for the sheer joy of it.</p>

        <p>I chose <b>Software Engineering</b>—not just as a job, but as a forge for creativity. A space where logic and artistry collide. Where code becomes a canvas and curiosity the guiding light.</p>

        <p>And now, dear reader, I invite you into my world. A world of gleeful explanations, of formulas that <i>dance</i>, of diagrams that <i>sing</i>. Curiosity, after all, is like a bag of crisps to a seagull: messy, irresistible, and always worth the chase.</p>
