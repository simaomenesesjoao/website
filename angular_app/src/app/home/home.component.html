<h2>Welcome to my digital playground!</h2>
<p> Here you'll find a collection of
 interactive articles where Physics, Mathematics, and Programming 
 collide in unexpected ways. These are the projects that keep me up at 
 night — not because they're terrifying, but because they're really fun to think about.
 It is a compilation of the projects I personally enjoy
  exploring and feel excited talking about. Here are some examples:</p>

  How would you hit the ball if it's in two places at the same time?

    <h2> What this website is about</h2>
    This website is part personal blog, part laboratory. It's a space where I can dive deep into the 
    juicy details of topics that spark my curiosity. Each post is the refined result of months of research, 
    programming and animation, distilled into something that is hopefully as fun to read as it was to create.
    This website will likely get updated on a monthly basis, as soon as I finish anything
    sufficiently cool to talk about.

<h2> Philosophy behind the website</h2>
<p>I'm a firm believer that one of the best ways to learn is through curiosity and interaction, 
regardless of the topic. For me there's nothing more fun than learning by doing, experimenting, and 
breaking things on the way. </p>

<p>However, real understanding only comes when trying to explain to
others, and for the purpose of this website, it comes down to two things: visualization and writing.</p>

<p>I decided to invest in visualization and interactive 
demonstrations because they can be invaluable explanation tools. A clever 
visual can turn confusion into insight, and a bit of 
 interactivity can turn a dry formula into something you feel rather than just memorize.</p>

<p>Writing, on the other hand, helps me structure my thoughts, organize messy ideas,
and break them down to their essence. In a way, it forces me to
learn things twice — once by doing, and once by explaining.</p>

<p>Hence, I didn't write this website out of altruistic intentions alone. It's also an active effort 
to deepen my knowledge and knowledge-sharing abilities.  </p>
